I found stack handling to be the toughest part of the following prgramme. I feel it can still be improved with some practice tought.
One error I made was while popping from the stack I was loading then incrementing sp while it should be the other way around (If while pushing you store and then decrement).
The generally large codebase you get for even simple programmes in assembly is another problem. I feel that cannot b improved with practice and is an inherent challenge of trying to directly (Or with assistance of a C programme) write in assembly


For isLessthan I pass the parameters in a0, a1, a2, a3.
for numLessthan one of the parameters is on the stack (I took it to be the first i.e real part of elt. I realize it should actually have been the value of end on the stack but implementation wise it is equivalent and works just as well)
I have also followed proper caller and calee conventions.
